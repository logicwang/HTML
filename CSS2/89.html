    <p>In my younger and more vulnerable
        years my father gave me some advice
        that I've been turning over
        in my mind ever since.
        'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,'
        he told me,
        'just remember that all the people in this world
        't had the advantages that you've had.'</p>
